        <div class="subheading mb-5">Customer Experience EvaluatorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">It is an honor to introduce myself here! My name is Yibo Wang, and I was born on August 27, 1999. I am a Chinese student studying in the United States. My current major is Underclear. I had an internship at Schindler Elevator Company in June 2020. During the internship, I served as the secretary of the company's human resources minister. I have strong ability to communicate with others and understand language.I am very good at getting along with people, so I have learned all kinds of knowledge about physical sales. During this period I gained some very precious experience. The success of a company is inseparable from a sound order, a perfect framework, and products that meet the customer base. I personally think that among these three necessary conditions, the product is the most important. To make products that meet the satisfaction of consumer groups, it is necessary to understand consumers' feedback on using related products and their willingness to consume.<br><br>

        I have relevant internship experience and have a certain working foundation for meeting customer requirements and understanding customer needs. And since the internship process, I have never received complaints or dissatisfaction from clients. On the contrary, my internship results are the best among fresh interns. Many people tend to ignore the role of the department in the company or a team. This is also one of the important factors that some sales groups cannot make profits. I have certain advantages in customer communication. This also mentioned a great help for my growth and learning. And in the process of customer communication, customers can often get valuable suggestions on product opinions and opinions. These suggestions are very real. Compared with the perfunctory filling out the questionnaire, they will show more true feelings in the conversation. Customer experience feedback is not a common profession, but I firmly believe in the big market in the future. People will pay more and more attention to the product quality and design concepts around them. These feedbacks from customers are very precious and rare. It is impossible to get customers' views and opinions on all aspects of the product only through pure service departments or questionnaires. This is an occupation that will inevitably become popular in an increasingly competitive market.<br><br>

        In addition, I have participated in supporter activities many times. This includes taking care of the elderly and disseminating knowledge about life safety. He also won the runner-up in the provincial competition of Chinese e-sports. My role in these activities is often the leader. I think I have certain leadership skills. I am honest and trustworthy, have a rigorous and serious working attitude, flexible in thinking about things, and know how to use all the resources around me in specific situations. Possess a positive attitude towards life and a wide range of hobbies, as well as good psychological quality and hard-working spirit, a unique understanding of things, and a strong ability to cooperate. I have the vigor and vitality unique to young people, and I have the brain and courage to start a career. During the current school, I use vacation and spare time to participate in a series of activities to enrich my knowledge and prepare for work after graduation.
